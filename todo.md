## Ideas for non-gamepay features:
* Add ability to zoom
* Add pause and ability to save/load settings

## Ideas for gameplay
* Add ability to move ring as well as rotate
* Make color change fluid around the ring instead of suddenly changing colors
  * Projectiles could be any color along the outside of the circle and you score more points for hitting closer to a part of the circle that matches it in color. If the difference is higher than a certain threshold, it actually has a negative impact on score (to incentivize dodging some projectiles while catching others, since you cannot catch every one on the correct color once you get above a certain spawn rate).
* Leave part of the ring "hollow". Some projectiles don't match any color and you need to "thread" them through the hollow points.
* Instead of track score you have "energy" that is constantly decreasing and every hit gives you more
  * As the game goes on, projectiles get harder to catch making energy more difficult to aquire.
  * You can use energy for temporary speed/turn rate boosts
* Projectile spawn rate isn't fixed, but instead projectiles come in bursts/waves followed by small periods of peace.
